      "\n",
      "1. üóÇ Strategy Name: Iron Condor\n",
      "   - Description: An iron condor involves selling a call spread and a put spread on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date. This creates a range where the trade can profit.\n",
      "   - Why this fits the trader: This strategy suits traders who have a knack for managing multiple positions, can stay calm under pressure and are comfortable with limited price movements ‚Äì all characteristics shown by the trader.\n",
      "   - Best conditions for this strategy: Ideal for a market that's expected to move sideways or within a relatively tight range.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. üóÇ Strategy Name: Diagonal Call Spread\n",
      "   - Description: A diagonal call spread involves buying a longer-term call option and selling a shorter-term call option with a higher strike price. This strategy profits from both time decay and a moderate upward move in the underlying asset.\n",
      "   - Why this fits the trader: The trader has shown success with calendar spreads, which are similar in structure but benefit from different price movements. This could provide a new way to apply their existing skills.\n",
      "   - Best conditions for this strategy: Suited for a moderately bullish market where the underlying asset is expected to increase in price, but not drastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. üóÇ Strategy Name: Butterfly Spread\n",
      "   - Description: A butterfly spread involves selling two options at the same strike price while buying one option at a lower strike price and another at a higher strike price. All options have the same expiration date. This strategy profits if the underlying asset stays close to the middle strike price.\n",
      "   - Why this fits the trader: The trader has shown a propensity to improvise and a willingness to learn, which will be useful in managing this slightly more complex strategy. They have also shown a preference for strategies that benefit from limited price movement.\n",
