    {
      "strategy_name": "Long Straddle",
      "rank": 1,
      "reason": "The Long Straddle strategy ranks first due to its high profit potential in volatile markets and its alignment with the trader's adaptability. This strategy allows the trader to profit from significant price movements in either direction, offering flexibility in various market conditions."
    },
    {
      "strategy_name": "Iron Condor",
      "rank": 2,
      "reason": "The Iron Condor ranks second due to its defined risk-reward setup, which aligns with the trader's risk management skills. This strategy works best in range-bound markets, making it less adaptable than the Long Straddle but still potentially profitable."
    },
    {
      "strategy_name": "Butterfly Spread",
      "rank": 3,
      "reason": "The Butterfly Spread ranks third due to its reliance on the underlying asset remaining close to the middle strike price until expiration. While this strategy aligns with the trader's understanding of time decay, it offers less profit potential and adaptability compared to the Long Straddle and Iron Condor."
