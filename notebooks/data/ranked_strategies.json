    {
      "strategy_name": "Covered Call",
      "rank": 1,
      "reason": "The Covered Call strategy ranks first due to its ability to generate income and limit downside risk, which aligns with the trader's strengths. It also adapts well to a neutral or slightly bullish market, providing flexibility in various market conditions."
    },
    {
      "strategy_name": "Butterfly Spread",
      "rank": 2,
      "reason": "The Butterfly Spread is ranked second due to its defined risk-reward set-up and its ability to profit from time decay and limited price movement. However, it requires the market to be stable or slightly bullish, which may limit its adaptability in more volatile markets."
    },
    {
      "strategy_name": "Iron Condor",
      "rank": 3,
      "reason": "The Iron Condor strategy is ranked third as it requires the underlying asset to trade within a defined range until the options expire. While it aligns with the trader's preference for strategies that profit from time decay and limited price movement, its success is dependent on low volatility, stable markets, making it potentially less adaptable to changing market conditions."
