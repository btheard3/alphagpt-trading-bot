      "strategy_name": "Diagonal Call Spread",
      "description": "This involves buying a long-term call option and selling a short-term call option with a higher strike price on the same underlying asset.",
      "why_it_fits": "The trader has demonstrated an understanding of time decay and the use of options with different expiration dates. This strategy allows for profit from both time decay and price movement, providing a balance between the trader's demonstrated skills and willingness to improvise.",
      "best_conditions": "This strategy works best when the market is moderately bullish, which allows for the long-term call to increase in value while the short-term call expires worthless."

    {
      "strategy_name": "Iron Condor",
      "description": "An iron condor involves selling a call spread and a put spread on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date. This is a neutral strategy that profits from a lack of price movement and time decay.",
      "why_it_fits": "The trader has shown a preference for strategies that profit from time decay, and an iron condor allows for this while also providing a broader range for the underlying asset price to move without impacting profitability.",
      "best_conditions": "This strategy works best in a stable market with low volatility, which aligns with the trader's demonstrated preference for strategies that profit from time decay."

    {
      "strategy_name": "Long Straddle",
      "description": "This involves buying a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date on the same underlying asset.",
      "why_it_fits": "This strategy can be seen as a way to 'improvise' in the face of market uncertainty, as it profits from significant price movements in either direction. This could be a good fit for the trader's willingness to improvise and adapt to changing market conditions.",
      "best_conditions": "A long straddle works best in volatile markets where large price movements are expected, which could provide an opportunity for the trader to learn and adapt."
