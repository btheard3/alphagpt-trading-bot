      "strategy_name": "Iron Condor",
      "description": "An iron condor involves selling a call spread and a put spread on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date. This creates a range where the trade can profit.",
      "why_it_fits": "This strategy suits traders who have a knack for managing multiple positions, can stay calm under pressure and are comfortable with limited price movements \u2013 all characteristics shown by the trader.",
      "best_conditions": "Ideal for a market that's expected to move sideways or within a relatively tight range."

    {
      "strategy_name": "Diagonal Call Spread",
      "description": "A diagonal call spread involves buying a longer-term call option and selling a shorter-term call option with a higher strike price. This strategy profits from both time decay and a moderate upward move in the underlying asset.",
      "why_it_fits": "The trader has shown success with calendar spreads, which are similar in structure but benefit from different price movements. This could provide a new way to apply their existing skills.",
      "best_conditions": "Suited for a moderately bullish market where the underlying asset is expected to increase in price, but not drastically."
    },
    {
      "strategy_name": "Butterfly Spread",
      "description": "A butterfly spread involves selling two options at the same strike price while buying one option at a lower strike price and another at a higher strike price. All options have the same expiration date. This strategy profits if the underlying asset stays close to the middle strike price.",
      "why_it_fits": "The trader has shown a propensity to improvise and a willingness to learn, which will be useful in managing this slightly more complex strategy. They have also shown a preference for strategies that benefit from limited price movement.",
      "best_conditions": "A butterfly spread works best in a market that's expected to move sideways or within a tight range."
