Based on the criteria given, here is my ranking:

1. **Covered Call Writing**
   - Profit Potential: Moderate. The profit is limited to the premium received from selling the call options, but it is a safe and steady source of income.
   - Fit for Calendar Spread Trader: Moderate. While not exactly a calendar spread, the concept of time decay and premium collection is similar.
   - Risk Management Flexibility: High. The risk is limited to the potential decrease in the underlying asset's price, and the premium received provides some downside protection.

2. **Iron Condor**
   - Profit Potential: High. The Iron Condor strategy allows the trader to collect premium from both a call spread and a put spread, increasing the potential profit.
   - Fit for Calendar Spread Trader: High. This strategy uses time decay to its advantage, much like a calendar spread. 
   - Risk Management Flexibility: Moderate. While the risk is limited to the difference between the strike prices minus the net premium received, it requires careful management to avoid losses if the underlying asset's price moves significantly.

3. **Long Straddle**
   - Profit Potential: High. This strategy has unlimited profit potential if the underlying asset's price moves significantly.
   - Fit for Calendar Spread Trader: Low. This strategy is more about volatility than time decay and might be a bit of a stretch for a calendar spread trader.
   - Risk Management Flexibility: Low. The risk is limited to the premium paid for the options, but there is no way to minimize losses if the underlying asset's price doesn't move enough to cover the cost of the options.

So based on the ranking criteria, Covered Call Writing is the most suitable strategy for the trader. It provides a moderate profit potential with high risk management flexibility, and it fits reasonably well with a calendar spread trading style. However, this does not mean the other strategies are not valuable. They provide additional options for the trader, depending on the market conditions and the trader's risk tolerance.
