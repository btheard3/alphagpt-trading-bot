Based on the criteria provided, here is my ranking and analysis:

1. **Double Calendar Spread**
    - **Profit Potential**: High. You can profit from time decay and changes in implied volatility while the underlying asset remains within a specific range. The profit is typically higher than a single calendar spread due to using both puts and calls.
    - **Fit for a trader who favors calendar spreads**: High. This is a natural progression from a single calendar spread as it uses the same concept but with puts and calls.
    - **Risk Management Flexibility**: Moderate. The risk is limited to the initial debit paid, but adjustments can be tricky because of the multiple legs, and it may require more capital to adjust.

2. **Iron Condor**
    - **Profit Potential**: Medium. The maximum profit is limited to the net premium received for setting up the trade, which is typically lower than the potential profit from a double calendar spread.
    - **Fit for a trader who favors calendar spreads**: Moderate. This strategy also profits from a range-bound market, but it is a more complex strategy involving four option legs.
    - **Risk Management Flexibility**: High. The maximum risk is defined and known upfront. It's also possible to adjust the individual legs or the whole structure to manage risk.

3. **Butterfly Spread**
    - **Profit Potential**: Low to Medium. The maximum profit is obtained if the underlying asset price is exactly at the strike price of the short options at expiration.
    - **Fit for a trader who favors calendar spreads**: Low. The payoff structure is similar, but the strategy is more complex and requires precise prediction of the underlying asset price at expiration.
    - **Risk Management Flexibility**: Moderate. The risk is limited to the initial debit paid, but adjustments can be complex due to the multi-leg nature of the strategy.

Remember, all strategies have their own unique advantages and disadvantages, and the best strategy will depend on your specific goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook.
